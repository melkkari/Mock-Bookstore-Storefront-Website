<h4>Sweetshelf - Reading Is Bliss</h4>

The first Sweetshelf store opened in 1964, and Sweetshelf has since retained its respect for books and the importance of preserving them to enrich and empower readers. </p>

Here at Sweetshelf, we maintain values from Sweetshelf's founder, Tom Fernsby, who believed in the transformative power of reading and would do his best to enable the illiterate and less fortunate.
As Tom Fernsby once did, we at Sweetshelf value books for their improvement of mental faculties, their entertainment, and the cultural and historical significance of the written word.</p>
</div>

<p class = "FAQp">
Under the leadership of Tom Fernsby's grandson, Michael Fernsby, we continue to pride ourselves on Sweetshelf's integrity and valuable service.
We continue to expand in the hopes of supporting literature, recently opening our 200th branch in the UK and establishing a robust online presence to better serve the modern reader, regardless of where they are in the world. </p>
